/**

 Relational Operators and the if Statement
 Compile and Run the following program. Then
 do the following exercises.
 ï¿¼
 Exercise 1: Run the program several times using a different input each time.
 Does the program do what you expect? Is so, explain what it is doing.
 If not, locate the error and fix it.

 Exercise 2: Modify the program so that the user inputs both values to be tested
 for equality. Make sure you have a prompt for each input.
 Test the program with pairs of values that are the same and that are different.

 Exercise 3: Modify the revised Exercise 2 program by replacing the two if statements
 with a single if/else statement. Run the program again to test the results.
