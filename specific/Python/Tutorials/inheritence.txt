in python terms


class Amy:
    cat = 'scale'
    dog = 'sundial'


class Peter(Amy):
    cat = 'iamcat'


class James(Amy):
    fish = 'feesh'


Peter.cat == 'iamcat'
Amy.dog == 'sundial'
Amy.cat == 'scale'
Peter.dog == 'sundial'
James.cat == 'scale'
James.dog == 'sundial'

Amy.fish == ''
Peter.fish == ''
James.fish == 'feesh'

super = daddy

Peters daddy is Amy because Peters daddy is Amy

so Peters super.cat = scale(not python syntax)
